# Autonomous-Shuttle-Vissim-Integration
This repository has the code folder corresponding to the code folder in the EDM integration that can be found in PTV Vissim installation folder. 

The code describes the modifications made to achieve the simulation of an Autonomous Shuttle in a signalized arterial. In the code you will find the necesarry changes in the code, parameters and attributes to integrate the Intelligent Driving Model (IDM) based on calibrated values from [Favero and Elefteriadou (2024)](
